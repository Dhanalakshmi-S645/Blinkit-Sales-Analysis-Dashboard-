## 🌟 Project Spotlight
Transforming raw Blinkit sales data into **strategic intelligence** through an end-to-end Power BI solution.

This dashboard empowers stakeholders to:
- Track revenue drivers across product attributes & outlets
- Understand customer preferences (ratings & fat content trends)
- Optimize inventory and outlet strategies
- Spot growth opportunities in tiered markets

Built with clean data modeling, custom DAX, and thoughtful UX design.

## 🎯 Business Goal
Deliver a **single-pane-of-glass** view to answer critical questions:
- Which product attributes drive the highest revenue?
- How do outlet characteristics (size, tier, age, type) influence performance?
- Where are satisfaction and sales efficiency strongest/weakest?
- What actionable optimizations can boost profitability?
